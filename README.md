## About The Project

The financial dashboard with machine learning prediction project aims to create a web-based dashboard that provides users with insights into financial data through machine learning models.

The dashboard will be built using modern web technologies such as ReactJS and NodeJS, and will allow users to visualize key financial metrics such as revenue, expenses, profit, and cash flow. The dashboard will also include a machine learning prediction module that will provide users with forecasts for future financial trends based on historical data.
